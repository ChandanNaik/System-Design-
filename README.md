## Interview Process
- Scope the problem
  1. Requirements clarifications
  2. System interface definition
  - Donâ€™t make assumptions.
  - Ask clarifying questions to understand the constraints and use cases.
- Sketch up an abstract design
  3. Back-of-the-envelope estimation
  4. Defining data model
  5. High-level design
  - Building blocks of the system
  - Relationships between them
- Identify and address the bottlenecks
  6. Detailed design
  7. Identifying and resolving bottlenecks
